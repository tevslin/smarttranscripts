# SmartTranscripts

This repository contains the open-source components of `sfgovernmentconnection.com` and provides a set of shareware building blocks for anyone who wants to create "SmartTranscripts" from YouTube or other video sources. SmartTranscripts have the searchability of text but easily play clips from the original video source of any selected snippet for verification or to get the depth of audio and video. SmartTranscripts link to the original video, which must be available online to the user.   

## Overview

The goal of this project is to provide a flexible framework for converting video of meetings into interactive, searchable, and shareable web pages. This can be done for a single meeting or as a fully automated "factory" that continuously processes new meetings as they are posted. 

### Use Cases

1.  **Single Meeting Transcript:** You can create a SmartTranscript for a single meeting by providing its video URL, a name for the meeting, and its date. This is useful for one-off transcriptions without setting up a full pipeline.

2.  **Automated Factory:** To automatically process meetings from a specific public body, you will need to write your own version of `customgetter.py`. This script is responsible for finding the latest meeting videos as they are posted online. Once you have a custom getter, the `factory.py` script can be run on a schedule to automate the entire process.

## Installation

This project was developed and tested using Python 3.13.5.


1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/tevslin/smarttranscripts.git # Or your forked repository
    cd smarttranscripts
    ```
2.  **Install FFmpeg:**

    This project requires `ffmpeg` to process audio from video files. If FFMPEG is not already properly installed, you will need to install it.

    *   **On macOS (using Homebrew):**
        ```bash
        brew install ffmpeg
        ```
    *   **On Windows:**
        Download a build from the official [FFmpeg website](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and add the `bin` directory to your system's PATH.

3.  **Verify FFmpeg Installation:**
    Run the `check_ffmpeg.py` script to confirm `ffmpeg` is correctly installed and accessible.
    ```bash
    python check_ffmpeg.py
    ```

4.  **Create and activate a Python virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Configure environment variables:**
    Copy `sample.env` to `.env` and fill in your API keys for OpenAI and Deepgram.
    ```bash
    cp sample.env .env
    # Open .env in your text editor and add your keys
    ```

## Quick Start: Single SmartTranscript

You can quickly generate a SmartTranscript for an individual meeting by providing its URL, a name, and a date.

Here's an example using a YouTube video:

```bash
python factory.py \
    --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XtF_Q5nF1kU" \
    --committee "Schools Committee" \
    --date "2025-10-10" \
    --jurisdiction "Sample Jurisdiction"
```
This command will:
*   Download the audio from the YouTube video.
*   Transcribe the audio using Deepgram.
*   Use OpenAI to identify speakers and generate an agenda.
*   Create an interactive HTML SmartTranscript in the `localhost/meetings/Schools_Committee/2025-10-10/` directory.

After generation, you will need to start a local web server from the `localhost` directory (see 'Local Hosting' below) and then navigate to the appropriate URL in your browser (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/meetings/Schools_Committee/2025-10-10/transcript.html`). Directly opening the HTML file will not work due to browser security restrictions.

## File Descriptions

### Root Directory Files

*   **`factory.py`**: The main orchestration script. It can be run to process a single meeting via command-line arguments or in batch mode to process all meetings for committees defined in `committees.json`.
*   **`setup_s3_cloudfront.py`**: A utility for creating and configuring an AWS infrastructure (S3 bucket, CloudFront distribution, Route 53 records) if you want to host your SmartTranscripts on AWS. They can be hosted locally or any modern web server capable of serving static web pages.
*   **`upload_framework.py`**: A script to upload the core "framework" files (CSS, JS) to your S3 bucket if you are using one. It uses a manifest to upload only the necessary files.
*   **`sync_meetings.py`**: A script to synchronize all generated meeting transcripts from your local `meetings` directory to the S3 bucket and invalidate the CloudFront cache.
*   **`meetingreporter.py`**: A core module that takes transcription data and generates the final, interactive HTML SmartTranscript page.
*   **`transcription.py`**: A module responsible for sending audio files to the Deepgram API for transcription.
*   **`videotools.py`**: A utility for downloading audio from various video stream URLs using `yt-dlp`.
*   **`check_ffmpeg.py`**: A standalone script to verify if `ffmpeg` is correctly installed and accessible in your system's PATH. Run this script to confirm your `ffmpeg` setup.
*   **`customgetter.py`**: An example "getter" script that finds recent meetings for a specific Granicus-based site. You will need to create your own version of this to support other jurisdictions or sources.
*   **`envloader.py`**: A small utility to load environment variables from `.env` files.
*   **`committees.json`**: A JSON file that defines the committees to be processed in batch mode, including their names, IDs, and optionally members.
*   **`requirements.txt`**: A list of all the Python packages required to run the scripts in this repository.
*   **`sample.env`**: A file for managing environment variables like API keys and bucket names. You will need to create your own .env with API keys for OpenAI and Deepgram.
*   **`.gitignore`**: Specifies files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
*   **`viewer_template.html`**: The HTML template into which meeting-specific data is injected to create the final SmartTranscript.

### `localhost` Directory Files

These files form the front-end framework for the SmartTranscript viewer. They are served alongside the generated HTML for each meeting.

*   **`index.html`**: The main landing page for the collection of transcripts. Not needed if you are only making single SmartTranscripts.
*   **`viewer_logic.js`**: The primary JavaScript file that "hydrates" the static HTML of a transcript, adding all interactivity like click-to-play, search, and sharing.
*   **`directory.js`**: Scans the `meetings` directory to build the folder hierarchy for the navigation pane.
*   **`toc_viewer.js`**: Controls the left-hand "Table of Contents" pane, including pinning, unpinning, and the flyout menu behavior.
*   **`navigation.js`**: Handles the logic for the navigation pane, which allows browsing meetings by committee and date.
*   **`style.css`**: The main stylesheet that defines the look and feel of the SmartTranscript viewer.
*   **`dropdown_styles.css`**: Specific styles for the dropdown menus used in the viewer.
*   **`loader.js`**: Manages the loading of other JavaScript modules.
*   **`tour.js` / `tour.css`**: Code for a guided tour feature to introduce users to the interface.
*   **`youtubePlayer.js`**: A wrapper for the YouTube IFrame API to standardize video player controls. Only required if the souce of you videos is YouTube.

## Hosting Your SmartTranscripts

The generated HTML files are static and can be hosted on any modern web server. Tools are provided for hosting on AWS but this is not a requirement.

### Local Hosting

For local development and testing, you can easily start a web server from within the `localhost` directory. This requires Python to be installed.

```bash
# Navigate to the localhost directory
cd implementations/smarttranscripts/localhost

# Start a simple Python web server
python -m http.server 8000
```
You can then access your transcripts at `http://localhost:8000` in your web browser.

### S3 / CloudFront Hosting

For a production environment, as used by `sfgovernmentconnection.com`, you can host the files on AWS. This repository includes several tools to facilitate this:

*   **`setup_s3_cloudfront.py`**: Use this script to create the S3 bucket and CloudFront distribution that will serve your website.
*   **`upload_framework.py`**: Run this script to upload the core JavaScript and CSS files to your bucket.
*   **`sync_meetings.py`**: After running the factory to generate new transcripts locally, run this script to upload them to S3 and update the meeting index.
