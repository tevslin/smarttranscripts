    <h1>About SmartTranscripts</h1>

    <p>
        SmartTranscripts are AI-generated transcripts and agendas of public meetings. They combine the searchability of text with the reliability of video.
    </p>

    <h2>What makes a transcript "Smart"?</h2>

    <p>
        Unlike plain text, SmartTranscripts are interactive. You can search them by keyword, phrase, or speaker. Most importantly, every sentence is linked directly to the original video source. This allows you to instantly play a video clip of any selected text to see and hear exactly what was said, with what expression, and how people reacted to it.
    </p>
    <p>
        SmartTranscripts and any clips you select from them are easily shareable on social media or via email, making it easier to cite and share important moments from public proceedings.
    </p>

    <h2>Implementations and Source Code</h2>
    <p>
        This technology is used to power several public service websites:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://goldendomevt.com" target="_blank">GoldenDomeVT.com</a> (Vermont Legislature)</li>
        <li><a href="https://sfgovernmentconnection.com" target="_blank">SFGovernmentConnection.com</a> (San Francisco City Government)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        The code for this project is open source and available on GitHub. You can use it to build your own SmartTranscripts factory for your jurisdiction.
